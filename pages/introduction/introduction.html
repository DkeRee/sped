            This site was specifically designed to tackle the speed test in the Trigonometry Honors course at Los Altos High School by giving you the ability to GENERATE NEW TESTS!
            If you are strugglin' a little bit and need just a little kick to get into the groove of ACEING YOUR NEXT speed test, this site will become your best friend.
            If you are a teacher and want to generate a COMPLETELY NEW speed test, this site will ALSO become your best friend.
            If you AREN'T from LAHS, that's fine too!
            Use it to practice all you want because it resembles the AUTHENTIC LAHS speed test!
            No more scouraging the web to find an online speed to test practice with because you now have SpedTest!

            Head over to the "Speed Test" section to get started right away! Press "Generate" to generate a fresh, new speed test.
            Once the classic 5 minutes are up, check your work (pencils down and hands up!) by clicking on the "Reveal" button!
            I highly recommend that you to print out the test LANDSCAPE MODE to work directly on it with paper by pressing the "Print" button. 
            This will best emulate the official testing environment. In the near future, I may add a "Settings" tab so that you can better customize the test to tackle areas you are most unfamiliar with.
            In the meantime, please share this with more people! Special shoutout to Ms. Yu and Mr. Tran for being baller teachers.
